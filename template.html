        AZCA Technologies is a company that specializes in technological innovation. Our mission is to implement artificial intelligence in technology, 
        increasing the capabilities of technology to aid the human world. One of the major projects we have been working on is Amrai (Applicable Machine Robot 
        Artificial Intelligence), a robot that aims to provide assistance in both business and education fields. We have identified the 
        tedious tasks students, teachers, and office workers can use assistance in and designed Amrai as a solution to them. Amrai utilizes 
        artificial intelligence to act as a mobile printer, deliver materials and paper, help format documents, place calls, and grade short responses.
