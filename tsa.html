      <br>
      <br>
       I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. 
      I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, 
      and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best
      in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. 
      I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. 
      I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind,
      I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief 
      in my God, and my fellow Americans.
