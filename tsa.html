        <p class="lead">Mission Statement</p>
        <p>The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career
          opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular
          activities, competitions, and related programs.</p>

        <p class="lead">Motto</p>
        <p> "Learning to lead in a technical world."</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Creed</p>
        <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I
          believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials,
          experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my
          own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better
          places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories
           that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of
            working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect
             for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of
             my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in
              my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
