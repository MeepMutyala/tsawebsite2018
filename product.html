      AZCA Technologies has identified the tedious tasks students, teachers, and office workers can use assistance in and designed Amrai as a solution to them. Amrai utilizes 
      artificial intelligence to act as a mobile printer, deliver materials and paper, help format documents, place calls, and grade short responses.

      Amrai can function as a mobile printer. Not only will it print out documents, but it will also deliver them to a requested location/computer. 
      Using wireless connection, any approved device (phone, laptop, computer, etc.) can send a file to be printed out by the robot. The robot will 
      then trace the IP address of the device that requested to print, and move to its location, using sensors to avoid bumping into walls. 
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
       <homeheader>Formatter</homeheader>
      <br>
      <br>
      Amrai will format specified sections of a document, or the entirety of a document upon request. It will have a menu that can be controlled by users, 
      allowing them to select how they would like their document to be formatted. If the robot does not have a formatting option they would like by default, 
      the user could either download formats from the internet, or upload their own format, which will be processed and stored by the robot, as well as 
      added to the menu (by user request) for future use. 
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
       <homeheader>Paper Transporter / Distributor</homeheader>
      <br>
      <br>
      Amrai can transport and deliver materials given to it or papers it prints out. When a material is given to the robot or a file is sent to the robot to be 
      printed, the identity of the recipient is given to the robot as well. Scanners are located on the robot that implement facial scanning software. Facial
      recognition is used to find the recipient of the materials.

    <div class="textbox">

      <br>
      <br>
      Amrai can place calls, make calls, schedule meetings, set reminders, make schedules, and organize files and documents. It does this using personal assistant 
      technologies previously developed, and requires vocal input to perform these tasks (so an administrator must say something like “make a call to Jeff Trout” 
      in order for the robot to do it), The robot has vocal recognition software and can be programmed by the user to only accept input for certain commands 
      from certain users.

    <div class="textbox">
       <homeheader>Automatic Short Response Grader</homeheader>
      <br>
      <br>
      Amrai identifies and understands key phrases in a response and compares them to rubric examples provided. Robot will scan the response for each category provided on the rubric, 
       and give points to the response for every rubric section it fulfills. 
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
       <homeheader>Substitute Teacher / Assistant</homeheader>
      <br>
      <br>
        For the Amrai to take over as substitute teacher, the teacher will have to leave work for the robot to tell the students what to do. The teacher will leave memos or instructions for 
       the robot to follow or read to the class.
