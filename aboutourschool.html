   The MOT Charter Academies were developed to nurture those students who love to explore their world. Our rigorous Arts and Science
      /Technology programs encourage students to question, debate, challenge and learn from all aspects of learning methods. The 
      classrooms, labs and studios on our campus include both open, engaging group areas, as well as places for smaller, more in 
      depth discussions of studentâ€™s work and thoughts. Since our inaugural year, MOT Charter High School has given students the 
      opportunity to earn college credits through our regular curriculum courses.  Our partnerships with Wilmington University and 
      Wesley College allow us to continue to expand the opportunities available to all grade levels. Dual enrollment courses are taught 
      in our school, by our certified faculty. Students and their families are encouraged to take advantage of the MOT Charter partnership 
      as it provides a significant savings over the regular course cost (typically over $1,000 per course) at the university level; however
      students are never required to take these classes for college credits. This year marks our first senior class, the Class of 2018.
      Our school has also recently finished construction of a gymnasium, and is continuing work on sports fields. Proudly, our school
      currently holds a 100% college acceptance rate, meaning all students who have applied to colleges have been accepted by at least one.
