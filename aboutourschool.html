        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>The MOT Charter Academies were developed to nurture those students who love to explore their world.
          Our rigorous Arts and Science /Technology programs encourage students to question, debate, challenge
          and learn from all aspects of learning methods. The classrooms, labs and studios on our campus include
          both open, engaging group areas, as well as places for smaller, more in depth discussions of studentâ€™s
          work and thoughts. Since our inaugural year, MOT Charter High School has given students the opportunity
          to earn college credits through our regular curriculum courses. Our partnerships with Wilmington
          University and Wesley College allow us to continue to expand the opportunities available to all grade levels.
          Dual enrollment courses are taught in our school, by our certified faculty. Students and their families are
          encouraged to take advantage of the MOT Charter partnership as it provides a significant savings over the
          regular course cost (typically over $1,000 per course) at the university level; however students are never
          required to take these classes for college credits. This year marks our first senior class, the Class of 2018.
          Our school has also recently finished construction of a gymnasium, and is continuing work on sports fields.
          Proudly, our school currently holds a 100% college acceptance rate, meaning all students who have applied
          to colleges have been accepted by at least one.</p>
