   Our Technology Student Association chapter meets once a week till the competition date where we work on our events
      and collaborate with each other in a safe, nurturing, and knowledgeable environment. Our chapter officers are committed 
      into proper organization and making sure everyone has fun while succeeding in their event. Students are also scheduled 
      to work after school if needed to work on their event. Over the course of the years our chapter has existed, our chapter
      has been growing constantly. It has also been home to state and national winners. Though we are a relatively new and small 
      chapter, each one of us are committed to strive for the best in each of our events and succeed in the technical world.
